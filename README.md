# Nutter
A simple script made in typescript using nodejs to cut the part you want of a youtube video


## How to use? 
First, you need to install NodeJS and PNPM (access some documentations for install them)
After all, just clone the project and run the following command on terminal:
```
pnpm start
```
After running, all the process will get done using the terminal
First, you need to insert the youtube URL for the video
Second, you need to insert the "start time" of the cut (Make sure you've put on this way "00:00:00")
Third, you need to insert the "end time" of the cut ("00:01:00")

Following my example, you'll get a 1 min duration video on the folder "public"
