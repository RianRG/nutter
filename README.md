A simple script made in typescript using nodejs to cut the part you want of a youtube video


## How to use? 
First, you need to install NodeJS and PNPM (access some documentations for install them)
After all, just clone the project and run the following command on terminal:
```
pnpm i && pnpm start
```
(This command install all dependencies and start Nutter.
After running, all the process will get done using the terminal

* First, you need to insert the youtube URL for the video
* Second, you need to insert the "start time" of the cut (Make sure you've put on this way "00:00:00")
* Third, you need to insert the "end time" of the cut ("00:01:00")

Following my example, you'll get a 1 min duration video on the folder "public"
